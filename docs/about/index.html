        <h1>About Myself</h1>
<h2>My name is <strong>Joshua Elijah Sandoval</strong>.</h2>
<p>I was born in March of 1998. Raised in Texas.
My father, <strong>Andrew</strong>, who is a C++ software engineer,
introduced me to web development in my early teen years.
And I begun a newfound love for programming.</p>
<p>I love to discover and learn new ways to be more productive.
I value <strong>cleanliness</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>performance</strong> in my code, and in my visual design.
My favorite programming languages are, first, the basic <strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong>.
But I also know <strong>SASS/SCSS</strong>, <strong>NPM</strong>, <strong>SVG</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>,
a bit of <strong>WordPress</strong>, and so on...</p>
<p>I was raised in <strong><a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a></strong>.
I love to help edify and uplift others to becoming their fullest potential.
The Saints are a good people, and I am grateful to the church for supporting me,
and teaching me of Jesus Christ. <strong>He is Messiah.</strong>
His teachings of repentance inspire me to be better, to not give up,
to push forward and keep improving—myself, my work, and others.</p>
<p>In terms of leisure, besides pursuing my skills,
which takes the vast majority of my time—I love to be around my family first.
But I also appreciate the occasional sports, and watching both educational and recreational content.
And when I can, I enjoy a bit of gaming on the side as well.
My favorite game franchise is <strong>Horizon by Guerrilla Games</strong>, a PlayStation studio.</p>
