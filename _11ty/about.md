# About Myself
## My name is <strong>Joshua Elijah Sandoval</strong>.

I was born in March of 1998. Raised in Texas.
My father, **Andrew**, who is a C++ software engineer,
introduced me to web development in my early teen years.
And I begun a newfound love for programming.

I love to discover and learn new ways to be more productive.
I value **cleanliness**, <strong>accessibility</strong> and **performance** in my code, and in my visual design.
My favorite programming languages are, first, the basic **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.
But I also know **SASS/SCSS**, **NPM**, **SVG**, **PHP**, **SQL**,
a bit of **WordPress**, and so on...

I was raised in <strong>[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://churchofjesuschrist.org)</strong>.
I love to help edify and uplift others to becoming their fullest potential.
The Saints are a good people, and I am grateful to the church for supporting me,
and teaching me of Jesus Christ. <strong>He is Messiah.</strong>
His teachings of repentance inspire me to be better, to not give up,
to push forward and keep improving&mdash;myself, my work, and others.

In terms of leisure, besides pursuing my skills,
which takes the vast majority of my time&mdash;I love to be around my family first.
But I also appreciate the occasional sports, and watching both educational and recreational content.
And when I can, I enjoy a bit of gaming on the side as well.
My favorite game franchise is **Horizon by Guerrilla Games**, a PlayStation studio.
