	<h1>My name is Jes.</h1>
	<h2>I am a full-stack web developer.</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<p>
			I started my web development journey <strong>back in 2011</strong> after being inspired by
			the creations of popular YouTube video channels at the time, alongside my father's notice.
			He himself being a software architect <b>specializing in the C++ programming language.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			I quickly took an interest to <b>CSS</b>, the technology that builds the internet visually.
			Since its introduction to me; <strong>it rose to be my absolute favorite.</strong>
			I have since spent my years of experience studying and specializing in it.
			And have even developed my own design ideology harmonious to the craft.
			<strong>If I can visualize it, I can build it.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			During my years of learning and labour, <strong>I have seen the industry shift from technology to technology.</strong>
			In that ever-growing madness, I have come to appreciate simplicity.
			The importance of having a strong grasp of fundamentals cannot be understated.
			It allows one to <strong>quickly adapt to new and unknown challenges</strong> congruent to their existing skills.
			In this case, the trio of programming languages comprising the web: <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Running into mid 2023, in pursuit of mine own betterment;
			<strong>I decided to further my education in that of
			<a href="https://devmountain.com/" target="_blank">Devmountain</a>.</strong>
			Beside a cohort of fellow learners and developers, I mastered the art and
			gained confidence and invaluable insight into the profession.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the now present, I spend my time learning more.
			<strong>Always ready and able to overcome any new challenges pertaining to web development.</strong>
